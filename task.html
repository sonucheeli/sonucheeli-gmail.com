He was captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni is widely considered one of the greatest cricket captains, wicket-keeper-batsman and finishers in the history of cricket.[a] He plays as a right-handed wicket-keeper-batsman and is known for his calm captaincy and his ability to finish matches in tight situations. He is also the current captain of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.</p>

<h3 id="Awards">Awards</h3><p>After leading India for nine trophy-laden years, Mahendra Singh Dhoni finally called time on India's limited-overs captaincy career and we cannot be thankful enough to the Captain Cool. Taking up the reins during the most difficult phase of Indian cricket, in September 2007, Dhoni transformed the Indian team into a formidable outfit of world beaters. Not only did the Jharkhand Dynamite lead India to stupendous victories, he also ensured that Indian cricket goes through a smooth transition when his time as captain is up. 

The achievements of MS Dhoni as India's limited-overs captain are unparalleled as he remains the only captain to win all the three ICC major trophies. During his tenure as the skipper of the Indian side, Dhoni added honors at will to his overflowing Trophy cabinet. 

Here, we look at the awards and accolades won by MS Dhoni until now.

An international career that started with a duck, more often than not, would force Indians to sign off a player from the onset. However, the perception had undergone a change with Sachin Tendulkar. Dhoni followed that with supreme authority in the 21st century. Out for a duck in the first match as an international player, Dhoni went on to etch his name in the annals of Indian 
cricket history as one of the most celebrated cricketers of all-time. In the process, Dhoni also went on to be bestowed with many achievements and accolades.</p>
